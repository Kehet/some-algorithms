/**
 * Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that organizes an unsorted list by repeatedly finding the smallest
 * (or largest) element and moving it to its correct position.
 *
 * 1. Start with the entire stack, pick out the smallest card, and place it on the left side (the start of the sorted
 * section).
 *
 * 2. Go through the rest of the cards, find the next smallest card, and move it next to the sorted section. Each time,
 * the sorted section on the left grows by one card.
 *
 * 3. Keep doing this until there are no cards left in the unsorted pile.
 *
 * Selection sort is straightforward but can be slow on large lists because it goes through the list repeatedly to
 * find the next smallest item. Itâ€™s best for small or nearly sorted datasets since its time complexity is O(n^2).
